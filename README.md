# IPEDS Database

> **Fork of [paulgp/ipeds-database](https://github.com/paulgp/ipeds-database)** by Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham. This fork ([truan/database-ipeds](https://github.com/truan/database-ipeds)) adds a data dictionary (`add_datapond_metadata.py`, `DICTIONARY.md`) and finance tables (`f1a`, `f2`, `f3`).

Build a harmonized [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database from 20+ years of
[IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) higher-education data in a single command.

```bash
uv run python build_database.py
```

The result is a ~1.2 GB database with **26.7 million rows** across **23 tables**
covering every U.S. postsecondary institution from 1997 to 2024—admissions,
enrollment, completions, tuition, financial aid, graduation rates, staffing,
and more—ready to query with SQL.

## Why?

IPEDS is the most comprehensive source of data on U.S. colleges and
universities. But working with it is painful: hundreds of separate CSV files,
naming conventions that change every few years, undocumented missing-value
codes, and race/ethnicity categories that were overhauled in 2008–2010.

This project handles all of that. One script downloads everything, harmonizes
the schemas across years, and loads it into a fast analytical database you can
query instantly.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [Python 3.11+](https://python.org) and
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/truan/database-ipeds.git
cd database-ipeds

# Install dependencies and build the database
uv sync
uv run python build_database.py
```

The first run downloads ~720 MB of ZIP files from NCES (cached in `~/ipeds/raw/`
so rebuilds are fast) and produces `~/ipeds/ipeds.duckdb` (~1.1 GB).

Then query with any DuckDB client:

```bash
duckdb ~/ipeds/ipeds.duckdb
```

```sql
-- MBA degrees over time
SELECT year,
       SUM(CAST(COALESCE(ctotalt, crace24, crace15 + crace16) AS BIGINT)) AS mbas
FROM   c_a
WHERE  CAST(cipcode AS VARCHAR) = '52.0201' AND award_level = 7
GROUP  BY year ORDER BY year;
```

Or from Python:

```python
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect("~/ipeds/ipeds.duckdb", read_only=True)
con.sql("SELECT * FROM _metadata").show()
```

### Built-in Views

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `v_institutions` | Latest directory info per institution (deduplicated) |
| `v_admission_rates` | Admission and yield rates with institution names |
| `v_tuition_trends` | In-state/out-of-state tuition with institution info |

## Key Columns

The `hd` table renames IPEDS codes to readable names:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `institution_name` | Institution name |
| `state` | State abbreviation |
| `sector` | 1 = Public 4-yr, 2 = Private nonprofit 4-yr, 3 = For-profit 4-yr, … |
| `control` | 1 = Public, 2 = Private nonprofit, 3 = Private for-profit |
| `level` | 1 = 4-year, 2 = 2-year, 3 = Less than 2-year |
| `carnegie_basic` | Carnegie classification (harmonized across name changes) |
| `hbcu` | HBCU flag |
| `longitude` / `latitude` | Coordinates |

The `adm` table renames admissions columns:
- `applicants_total`, `admissions_total`, `enrolled_total` (plus `_men`/`_women`)
- `sat_math_25th`, `sat_math_75th`, `act_composite_25th`, etc.

The **`c_a`** (completions) table uses these key codes:

| Column | Values |
|--------|--------|
| `cipcode` | 6-digit CIP code (e.g., `52.0201` = MBA) |
| `award_level` | 5 = Bachelor's, 7 = Master's, 9 = Doctor's (pre-2010), 17 = Research doctorate (2008+), 18 = Professional practice doctorate (2008+) |
| `ctotalt` | Total completions (2008+); use `COALESCE(ctotalt, crace24, crace15 + crace16)` for full series |

The **`f1a`** (public) and **`f2`** (private nonprofit) finance tables include endowment data:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `f1h01` / `f2h01` | Endowment value, beginning of fiscal year |
| `f1h02` / `f2h02` | Endowment value, end of fiscal year |
| `f1h03` / `f2h03` | Net change in endowment |
| `f1h03a` / `f2h03a` | Contributions to endowment |
| `f1h03b` / `f2h03b` | Investment return |
| `f1h03c` / `f2h03c` | Amounts spent/withdrawn |

All other tables preserve original IPEDS column names (lowercased) for
compatibility with the [IPEDS data dictionary](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx).

## Example Queries

See [`examples/query_examples.sql`](examples/query_examples.sql) for 10
ready-to-run queries. A few highlights:

**Most selective universities (2023):**
```sql
SELECT h.institution_name,
       ROUND(a.admissions_total * 100.0 / a.applicants_total, 1) AS admit_rate
FROM   adm a
JOIN   hd h ON a.unitid = h.unitid AND a.year = h.year
WHERE  a.year = 2023 AND a.applicants_total > 20000
ORDER  BY admit_rate LIMIT 10;
```

**Top university endowments (FY2023):**
```sql
SELECT h.institution_name, h.state, CAST(f.f2h02 AS BIGINT) AS endowment
FROM   f2 f
JOIN   hd h ON f.unitid = h.unitid AND h.year = 2023
WHERE  f.year = 2023 AND f.f2h02 > 0
ORDER  BY endowment DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**In-state vs. out-of-state enrollment (first-time undergrads):**
```sql
SELECT c.year,
       SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(c.efcstate AS INT) = CAST(h.fips_state AS INT)
                THEN CAST(c.efres01 AS BIGINT) END) AS in_state,
       SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(c.efcstate AS INT) = 99
                THEN CAST(c.efres01 AS BIGINT) END) AS total
FROM   ef_c c
JOIN   hd h ON c.unitid = h.unitid AND c.year = h.year
WHERE  c.year IN (2022)
GROUP  BY c.year;
```

## Example Figures

The [`examples/figures/`](examples/figures/) directory contains R scripts that
produce publication-quality plots directly from the database:

| Script | Output |
|--------|--------|
| `degree_plots.R` | Bachelor's, MBA, and PhD degrees over time |

## Harmonization Notes

### Cross-Year Schema Changes

IPEDS survey instruments change frequently. This builder handles the
differences by taking the union of all columns across years; missing columns
for a given year are `NULL`.

Key changes the builder handles:

- **Race/ethnicity (2008–2010):** IPEDS switched from 5 categories to 9
  (separating Asian/Pacific Islander, adding Two or More Races). Both old
  and new columns are preserved.
- **Completions totals column:** Named `crace15 + crace16` (2000–2001),
  `crace24` (2002–2007), then `ctotalt` (2008+). Use
  `COALESCE(ctotalt, crace24, crace15 + crace16)` for a continuous series.
- **Doctorate types (2008+):** Pre-2010 used `award_level = 9` for all
  doctorates. Post-2008 splits into 17 (research) and 18 (professional
  practice). No institution overlap in the 2008–2009 transition years.
- **Carnegie classification:** Column name changed across years (`carnegie` →
  `ccbasic` → `c15basic` → `c18basic` → `c21basic`); the `hd` table maps all
  to `carnegie_basic`.
- **Admissions (ADM):** Became a separate survey in 2014. Prior admissions data
  is in the IC survey.
- **Financial aid (SFA):** Grew from 58 columns (2002) to 692 columns (2023)
  as net-price and income-bracket reporting expanded.
- **Residence (EF_C):** Full institutional coverage in even years only
  (2009+ odd years cover ~2,200 vs ~5,500 institutions in even years).
- **Finance (F1A/F2/F3):** Three separate tables by accounting standard—`f1a`
  (GASB, public institutions), `f2` (FASB, private nonprofits), `f3`
  (for-profit). Endowment columns use parallel naming (`f1h02` vs `f2h02`).
  Column counts vary from 72 to 522 across years as reporting expanded.

### Missing Values

IPEDS uses blank, `.` (SAS missing), and letter codes for missing data. All
are converted to `NULL`. Columns with >70% numeric values are auto-cast to
`DOUBLE`.

### Known Gaps

- `ef_d` 2001: NCES returns HTTP 404 for `EF2001D`
- `ic_ay` 2009–2012: downloaded as 0-row placeholder files from NCES
- `sfa` 2010: downloaded as 0-row placeholder file from NCES
- `sal_is` pre-2012: `SAL` without `_IS` suffix uses a different schema; omitted for now

These are documented in the `EXPECTED` dictionary's `known_missing` field in
`build_database.py` and excluded from validation failures.

## Building a Subset

To rebuild only specific tables (faster for development):

```bash
uv run python build_database.py hd c_a adm
```

## Resuming an Interrupted Build

The build supports two modes:

- **Resume (default):** only drops and rebuilds the specified tables,
  preserving completed tables. Safe to interrupt and re-run.
- **Fresh (`--fresh`):** deletes the entire database and rebuilds from scratch.
  Use this for a clean full build.

Downloaded ZIPs in `~/ipeds/raw/` are cached and never re-downloaded in
either mode.

```bash
# Check which tables are already built
uv run python build_database.py --status

# Full fresh rebuild (deletes DB first)
caffeinate -i uv run python build_database.py --fresh

# Build only the missing tables (resume mode)
uv run python build_database.py efia effy ef_a ef_b ef_c ef_d

# Rebuild specific tables (resume mode — other tables untouched)
uv run python build_database.py al f1a flags
```

Recommended workflow for a full build on an unreliable machine:

```bash
# Build in batches — each batch is safe to interrupt and resume
uv run python build_database.py hd ic ic_ay ic_py adm
uv run python build_database.py efia effy ef_a ef_b ef_c ef_d
uv run python build_database.py c_a sfa gr gr200 om
uv run python build_database.py eap sal_is al flags
uv run python build_database.py f1a f2 f3
```

To prevent macOS from sleeping during a long build:

```bash
caffeinate -i uv run python build_database.py
```

## Validation

Each build automatically validates tables against expected year ranges and
row-count floors. To run validation standalone (without rebuilding):

```bash
uv run python build_database.py --validate
```

This checks every table for missing years, unexpectedly low row counts, and
missing tables. Known upstream gaps (e.g., EF2001D returning 404) are excluded.
The exit code is 0 if all checks pass, 1 if any unexpected issues are found.

## Build Logs

Each run saves a timestamped log to `~/ipeds/logs/` (e.g.,
`build_2026-04-07_19-18-04.log`). Logs capture the same output shown in the
terminal. Check them for failed years, column count notes, and row counts.
